On October 22, 2017, Xiangyi Lu, a co-author on the SnpEff and SnpSift papers, died of ovarian cancer after a three year struggle.

Douglas Ruden, Xiangyi's husband and senior author on the papers, has requested that a non-mandatory gift of at least $10 for using SnpEff or SnpSift be donated to WSU to honor Xiangyi Lu.

All gifts will go to a newly named fund, the **"Xiangyi Lu Graduate Student Fellowship in Bioinformatics Fund."** with the goal of raising $1 million, in order to permanently endow one graduate student research position in bioinformatics every year.
