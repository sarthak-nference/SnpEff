### Database requests

1. Organism name:
2. Link gene definition file (e.g. GTF / GFF / GenBank):
3. Link to Genome FASTA file/s:
4. Link to CDS FASTA file:
5. Link to Protein FASTA file:

Note: Genome FASTA file might not be needed in some cases (e.g. GenBank files usually have genome sequence information)

Note: Either CDS or Protein FASTA files should be used to ensure correctness (sometimes these sequences are provided in the GenBank files).
